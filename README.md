measure_throughput_from_pcap


Includes two python scripts that measure network throughput based on a packet capture file read into the script. One version of the script is made to be run in an IDE where you can edit the variables. The other version is made to be run at the command line. It accepts two variables, the pcap file and the time interval of packet data.
